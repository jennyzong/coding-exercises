/*
Challenge:
1. Create a constructor function called 'Character'.
2. Give it 'name' and 'collectedItemsArr' properties. 
    - 'name' should hold the character’s name.
	- 'collectedItemsArr' should hold an array of items. 
       Initialise it to an empty array.
3. Create an 'addItem' method which takes in an item as 
   a parameter and adds it to 'collectedItemsArr'.
4. The addItem method should log out a sentence like 
   `Merlin now has: wand, map, potion`.
5. Check it’s working by creating several instances of 
   Character and adding items to their arrays.
